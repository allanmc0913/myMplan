### Improve User Interface Using CSS
We used CSS to improve the user interface of our website.  We added a banner at the top as well as a back button for all pages to increase the user experience.  Additionally, we put an appealing background and highlighted/outlined important text.  We added a table to sort class information to improve the organization of the data so it will be easy for users to comprehend.  Furthermore, we put all text behind a transparent gray background allowing the text to be more distinguishable.  CSS and HTML were used.  

### Map Class Locations
Utilizing the Google Maps API, we embedded a map showing the location of each section.  To increase the functionality, we made a dictionary that converted abbreviated locations to their full names.  For example, "MLB" was converted to "Modern Languages Building".  This ensured that ALL section locations correctly displayed the map.  HTML was used. 

### Real Time Images of Classrooms
The classroom feature is a link to an LSA website that shows pictures and details about classrooms.  When a user is on the section details page, there is a link below the embedded Google Map that then takes users to the LSA webpage displaying real time images and details of these classrooms.  It is limited to LSA and LSA RC classrooms.   For all other schools, it takes users to https://rooms.lsa.umich.edu/classrooms to avoid an error page.  Since the website is LSA only, it doesn't have information on classrooms for other schools.  The user is warned that the feature will only work on LSA and LSA RC classrooms.  HTML as well as Python was used.
